# Advent of Code 2022
This repo will contain my solutions for the Advent of Code 2022 puzzles.

I use Python.

So far I have not used direct spoilers, only general online searches and small tips from jpot.

I've had a long break in coding and I am still new to Python, so this is partly warm-up and partly learning completely new things.

Depending on the day, some solutions are quick, some are short, some have more readability and comments.
